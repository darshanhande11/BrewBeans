# BrewBeans

BrewBeans is a simple flutter application with backend and database hosted on firebase. The application can be used by a group of people where each of them brews coffee for the whole lot. So, to remember the taste and preferences of each person (part of a larger group) can be really troublesome and not everyone can get their hot drink with the desired choices.

BrewBeans solves this memorization problem by allowing each user to login into the application using email and password. The user once logged in can see the preferences of his group like their name, caffeine strength and sugars. Also, the user can update the preferences (name, caffeine strength and sugars) inside the settings.
